    <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
    <p style="color:red">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</strong> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <br>standard dummy
        text ever since the 1500s,<i>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled</i> it to make a type specimen book. <br>It has
        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <b>It was popularised in
        the 1960s</b> with <br>the release of Letraset
